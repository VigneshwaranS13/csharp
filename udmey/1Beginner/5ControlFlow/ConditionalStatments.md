## Conditional statements 

1. if/else statements
2. Switch/case statements

- we also have conditional operator (which is shortcut for using if and else)
` a? b : c`

## if/else

syntax :

```

if (condition)
	Statement
else if (anotherCondition)
	anotherStatment
else
    otherStatment
```

- if we have more than one line of code, then we need to enclose them with 
curly braces
- we can also have mutiple if else statements which is called `nested if/else`


## Switch/case

- switch we have variable and compare the value of the variable 
with different method

```
switch(variable)
{
 case var.method1();
        ...
		break;
 case var.method2();
        ...
		break;
 default :
        ...
		break;
 ```
