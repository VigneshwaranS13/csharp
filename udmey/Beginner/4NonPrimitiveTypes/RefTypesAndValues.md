## RefTypes and values
In csharp we have two main types from which we create new type

1. Structures
2. Classes

## Structures

- primtive types
- Custom strucures
- 

## Classes

- Arrays
- Strings
- Custom classes

## Value Tpes(Structures)

- when we create varible in value type a part of memory called `stack` is allocated
for that varible
- Memory allocation done automatically
- when this variable get out of scope it will immediately
get removed from stack by runtime /CLR
 

##  Reference Types (Classes)

- Programmer need to allocate the memory with the new operator
- Memory alloccation happen in different area of memory called `heap`
- This memory is more sustainable
- so the object created in heap memory will continue in memory for little
while even if the object get out of scope
- it will get removed by the process called `Garbage collector` while runtime or by CLR
