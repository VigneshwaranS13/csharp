## List

- Arrays have fixed size,once we create them we cannot change the size
- if we dont know the number of objects which we are going to use then we cant use arrays,That's where `List` comes into the picture
- similar to array ,List is a data structure for storing number of objects of the same type

- To create a list

`var numbers = new List<int>();`

######### Generic tips :
- when we work on generic type we need to mention the generic type inside the angle bracket
-  we can initialize list using object initialization method

`var numbers = new List<int>() { 1,2,3,4};`

## Useful methods :

- Add()
- AddRange()
- Remove()
- RemoveAt()
- IndexOf()
- Contains()
- Count()
